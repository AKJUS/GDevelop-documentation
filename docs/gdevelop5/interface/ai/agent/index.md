# Build with AI: the AI agent

The **AI agent** is an AI specialized to build games using the GDevelop engine.

## How to use it

To open Ask AI, click the "Ask AI" button in the top-right corner of the GDevelop interface. Select **"Build for me"**, then type your request and click Send ‚Äî that‚Äôs it.

## What the AI agent can build for you

The AI agent has knowledge of all GDevelop features and official, reviewed extensions. It also has a view of your whole game, and can if necessary inspect your game events or scenes.

As with an AI powered tool, the result will vary according to what you ask. The AI agent is good for:

- Doing simple changes ("Make an object bigger"),
- Creating new features ("Make an enemy that attacks the player"),
- Experimenting ("Make the key move away from the player when they try to reach it")
- Learning new concepts - by watching what the AI does for you.

The AI will reply in a few seconds after your request. It will then progressively take actions in your game. This can be:

- Creating a scene,
- Adding a new object,
- Adding a behavior to an object,
- Creating or modifying events to build the logic of your game,
- Placing game objects on the scene,
- And more.

The AI will try to fulfill the request as much as it can. It will show on the screen a summary of everything it is doing. Some steps can also have extra details you can inspect.

!!! warning

    As with every AI tool, what the AI is doing is not perfect. From time to time, it can confuse some concepts, misunderstanding your game or what you're trying to do.
    Always double check what the AI does: you can keep continuing as long as it looks useful or stop and rework yourself what was created.


You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up requests. If you want to switch topics or ask something unrelated, click **"Start a new chat"** ‚Äî this helps the AI better focus on your new request.

## Cost of an AI request

Each account starts with a few **free AI requests**. If you have a GDevelop Gold or Pro subscription, you‚Äôll receive more every month ‚Äî 25 with Gold and 75 with Pro.

!!! note

    Once you've used all free requests, a request to the AI agent you send costs 4 to 20 credits. This means that with [a package of 500 credits](/gdevelop5/interface/profile/credits), you can make from 30 to 100 requests. Remember you can get **free credits by following GDevelop accounts** on socials ‚Äî check your profile!

## Help us improve the AI

You can rate the AI‚Äôs answers with a üëç or üëé. These ratings help the GDevelop team improve the assistant.

!!! note

    Sometimes, high demand can temporarily slow things down or prevent a proper response. If that happens, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be charged credits or lose your free requests.
