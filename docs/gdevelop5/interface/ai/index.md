Unlike general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Gemini, GDevelop AI is **tailored for game creation**. It knows how GDevelop works and can help you:

- Understand features and how to use them
- Build specific mechanics or systems
- Explore, brainstorm and bring new ideas to life

!!! tip

    Think of it as a mentor and creative collaborator that speaks GDevelop fluently.

## How does it work: AI agent and AI chat

The AI understands all built-in GDevelop features and official, reviewed extensions (it doesn‚Äôt include community extensions unless they‚Äôve been approved by the GDevelop team). It can also read the content of your game project when you ask it to build something for you.

The AI has two operating modes:

- **[Build for me (AI agent)](./agent)**: the AI will build your request inside your game. This can range from simple changes ("Make this object bigger") to more complex requests ("Create an enemy that starts attacking when the player comes near").
- **[Ask a question (AI chat)](./chat)**: the AI will answer any question you ask it about game development and usage of GDevelop.

## About privacy

GDevelop AI is **not trained on your game projects** - be it local or cloud projects. Cloud projects are stored separately from the GDevelop AI infrastructure and the AI has no access to them.

GDevelop AI is built on general purpose Large Language Models that we can be adapted, fine tuned or have internally multiple agents working on a request. In all cases there is no usage of private data for improving the AI.

## Help us improve the AI

You can rate the AI‚Äôs answers with a üëç or üëé. These ratings help the GDevelop team improve the assistant.

!!! note

    Sometimes, high demand can temporarily slow things down or prevent a proper response. If that happens, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be charged credits or lose your free requests.
