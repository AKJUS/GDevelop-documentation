# Ask AI: Get Help Building Your Game with AI

**Ask AI** is an experimental chat assistant designed specifically to help you create your game in GDevelop.

Unlike general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Gemini, this AI is **tailored for GDevelop**. It knows how GDevelop works and can help you:

- Understand features and how to use them
- Build specific mechanics or systems
- Explore and brainstorm new ideas

Think of it as a mentor that speaks GDevelop fluently.

## How does it work

The AI understands all built-in GDevelop features and official, reviewed extensions (it doesn‚Äôt include community extensions unless they‚Äôve been approved by the GDevelop team). It also has access to *an overview* of your project, which includes:

- Your game scene names
- Global objects and objects in each scene (but not their exact configuration),
- Object behaviors (but not their exact configuration),
- Global, scene and object variables (but not their content).

It **does not** currently have access to your scene events. It also has no access or details given about your username, profile, cloud projects, leaderboards, analytics or any personal detail from your user account.

## How to use it

To open Ask AI, click the "Ask AI" button in the top-right corner of the GDevelop interface.
Type your question and click Send ‚Äî that‚Äôs it.

Each account starts with a few **free AI answers**. If you have a GDevelop Gold or Pro subscription, you‚Äôll receive more every month ‚Äî 25 with Gold and 40 with Pro. (Note that these amounts may change as we learn more about how creators use the AI.)

!!! note

    Once you've used all free answers, a message you send to the AI costs 5 credits. This means that with [a package of 500 credits](/gdevelop5/interface/profile/credits), you can make up to 100 requests. Remember you can get **free credits by following GDevelop accounts** on socials ‚Äî check your profile!

    This is done to help pay for the expenses related to AI processing, and their maintenance.

The AI will reply in a few seconds. Answers often include links to helpful resources, extensions, behaviors, and relevant GDevelop concepts like actions or conditions.

!!! warning

    As with every AI tool, the AI answers are not perfect. From time to time, it can confuse some concepts, misunderstanding your game or what you're trying to do.
    Always double check the answers and use the AI answers as suggestions to build your game. It's a good idea to follow the **[Complete GDevelop Master Course](https://gdevelop.io/academy)** to quickly learn the basics of GDevelop and make your first games.

You can continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions. If you want to switch topics or ask something unrelated, click Start a new chat ‚Äî this helps the AI better focus on your new request.

## Help us improve the AI

You can rate the AI‚Äôs answers with a üëç or üëé. These ratings help the GDevelop team improve the assistant.

Sometimes, high demand can temporarily slow things down or prevent a proper response. If that happens, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you won‚Äôt be charged credits or lose your free requests.
