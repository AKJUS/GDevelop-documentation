# GDevelop 5

GDevelop is a full-featured, no-code, open-source game creation app. You can build **2D, 3D and multiplayer games**, as well as interactive presentations and experiences, for mobile (iOS, Android), desktop and the web. GDevelop is fast and easy to use: the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system and reusable behaviors.

GDevelop is perfect to build your first game projects in a few days — **even if you've never created a game before**.
If you're an experienced developer, animator or game designer, you'll be familiar with the concepts in a few minutes and you will be able to quickly create ambitious prototypes or full games.
