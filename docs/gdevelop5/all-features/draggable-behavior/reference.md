# Draggable Behavior Reference

Allows objects to be moved using the mouse (or touch). Add the behavior to an object to make it draggable. Use events to enable or disable the behavior when needed. [Read more explanations about it.](/gdevelop5/behaviors/draggable)



## Draggable object 

Move objects by holding a mouse button (or touch). 

### Behavior conditions

**Being dragged**  
Check if the object is being dragged. This means the mouse button or touch is pressed on it. When the mouse button or touch is released,  the object is no longer being considered dragged (use the condition "Was just dropped" to check when the dragging is ending).

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0: ðŸ‘¾ Object
    - Parameter 1: ðŸ§© Behavior

**Was just dropped**  
Check if the object was just dropped after being dragged (the mouse button or touch was just released this frame).

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0: ðŸ‘¾ Object
    - Parameter 1: ðŸ§© Behavior

_No expressions for this behavior._
