# Dialogue Tree Reference

Handle dialogue trees, made using Yarn Spinner. Useful to make complex dialogues with multiple choices. The Yarn Spinner editor is embedded in GDevelop so you can edit your dialogues without leaving GDevelop. [Read more explanations about it.](/gdevelop5/all-features/dialogue-tree)

## Actions

**Clear dialogue state**  
Clear dialogue state. This resets all dialogue state accumulated by the player choices. Useful when the player is starting a new game.

**Complete clipped text scrolling**  
Complete the clipped text scrolling. Use this action whenever you want to skip scrolling.

**Confirm selected option**  
Set the selected option as confirmed, which will validate it and go forward to the next node. Use other actions to select options (see "select next option" and "Select previous option").

**Go to the next dialogue line**  
Go to the next dialogue line. Use this to advance to the next dialogue line when the player presses a button.

**Load dialogue tree from a JSON file**  
Load a dialogue data object - Yarn JSON format, stored in a JSON file. Use this command to load all the Dialogue data at the beginning of the game.

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 1 (jsonResource): JSON file that holds the Yarn JSON data

    > Technical note: parameter 0 are internal parameters handled by GDevelop.

**Load dialogue tree from a scene variable**  
Load a dialogue data object - Yarn JSON format, stored in a scene variable. Use this command to load all the Dialogue data at the beginning of the game.

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (üóÑÔ∏è Scene variable): Scene variable that holds the Yarn JSON data

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (üóÑÔ∏è Global variable): Global Variable

**Save dialogue state**

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (üóÑÔ∏è Global variable): Global Variable

**Scroll clipped text**

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (üî¢ Number): Option index number

**Select previous option**  
Select previous option (subtract 1 from selected option number). Use this when the dialogue line is of type "options" and the player has pressed a button to change selected option.

**Set dialogue state boolean variable**  
Set dialogue state boolean variable. Use this to set a variable that the dialogue data is using.

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (string): State variable name
    - Parameter 1 (‚ùì True or False): New value

**Set dialogue state number variable**  
Set dialogue state number variable. Use this to set a variable that the dialogue data is using.

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (string): State variable name
    - Parameter 1 (üî¢ Number): New value

**Set dialogue state string variable**  
Set dialogue state string variable. Use this to set a variable that the dialogue data is using.

## Conditions

**Compare dialogue state boolean variable**

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (string): State variable
    - Parameter 1 (‚ùì True or False): Equal to

**Compare dialogue state number variable**

**Compare dialogue state string variable**  
Compare dialogue state string variable. Use this to trigger game events via dialogue variables.

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (string): State variable
    - Parameter 1 (string): Equal to

**Current dialogue branch contains a tag**

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 0 (string): tag name

**Current dialogue branch title**  
Check if the current dialogue branch title is equal to a string. Use this to trigger game events when the player has visited a specific dialogue branch.
