## Conditions

**Has achievement**  
Checks if a player owns one of this game's Steam achievement.

**Player bought the game**  
Checks if the current user actually bought & owns the game. If the "Require Steam" checkbox has been checked in the game properties, this will always be true as Steam will not allow to launch the game if it is not owned.

Check whether a state flag is set for a Workshop item.
