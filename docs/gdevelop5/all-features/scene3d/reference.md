### Effect "Ambient light":

A light that illuminates all objects from every direction. Often used along with a Directional light (though a Hemisphere light can be used instead of an Ambient light).

This effect is for 3D layers only.

Properties of this effect are:

- **Light color**. Default value is `255;255;255`. For events, write: `"color"`.
- **Intensity**. Default value is `0.75`. For events, write: `"intensity"`.

### Effect "Bloom":

Apply a bloom effect.

This effect is for 3D layers only.

Properties of this effect are:

- **Radius (between 0 and 1)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"radius"`.
- **Strength (between 0 and 3)**. Default value is `1`. For events, write: `"strength"`.
- **Threshold (between 0 and 1)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"threshold"`.

### Effect "Brightness and contrast.":

Adjust brightness and contrast.

This effect is for 3D layers only.

Properties of this effect are:

- **Brightness (between -1 and 1)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"brightness"`.
- **Contrast (between -1 and 1)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"contrast"`.

### Effect "Directional light":

A very far light source like the sun. This is the light to use for casting shadows for 3D objects (other lights won't emit shadows). Often used along with a Hemisphere light.

This effect is for 3D layers only.

Properties of this effect are:

- **Light color**. Default value is `255;255;255`. For events, write: `"color"`.
- **Distance from layer's camera**. Default value is `1500`. For events, write: `"distanceFromCamera"`.
- **Elevation (in degrees)**: Maximal elevation is reached at 90Â°.. Default value is `45`. For events, write: `"elevation"`.
- **Shadow frustum size**. Default value is `4000`. For events, write: `"frustumSize"`.
- **Intensity**. Default value is `0.5`. For events, write: `"intensity"`.
- **Shadow casting**. Default value is `false`. For events, write: `"isCastingShadow"`.
- **Shadow bias**: Use this to avoid "shadow acne" due to depth buffer precision. Choose a value small enough like 0.001 to avoid creating distance between shadows and objects but not too small to avoid shadow glitches on low/medium quality. This value is used for high quality, and multiplied by 1.25 for medium quality and 2 for low quality.. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"minimumShadowBias"`.
- **Rotation (in degrees)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"rotation"`.
- **Shadow quality**. Default value is `medium`. For events, write: `"shadowQuality"`.
- **3D world top**. Default value is `Z+`. For events, write: `"top"`.

### Effect "Fog (exponential)":

Exponential fog for 3D objects.

This effect is for 3D layers only.

- **Density**. Default value is `0.0012`. For events, write: `"density"`.

### Effect "Exposure":

Adjust exposure.

This effect is for 3D layers only.

Properties of this effect are:

- **Exposure (positive value)**. Default value is `1`. For events, write: `"exposure"`.

### Effect "Hemisphere light":

A light that illuminates objects from every direction with a gradient. Often used along with a Directional light.

- **Rotation (in degrees)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"rotation"`.
- **Sky color**. Default value is `255;255;255`. For events, write: `"skyColor"`.
- **3D world top**. Default value is `Z+`. For events, write: `"top"`.

### Effect "Hue and saturation":

Adjust hue and saturation.

This effect is for 3D layers only.

Properties of this effect are:

- **Hue in degrees (between -180 and 180)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"hue"`.
- **Saturation (between -1 and 1)**. Default value is `0`. For events, write: `"saturation"`.

### Effect "Fog (linear)":

Linear fog for 3D objects.

This effect is for 3D layers only.
