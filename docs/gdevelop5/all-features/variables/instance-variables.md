# Instance Variables


Instance variables is usually another term for [object variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables/object-variables).

Variables defined on objects are, during the game, available on each instance of the object living on the scene. This means that if you have an object "Tree", with a variable "LifeAmount", and that you put two "Tree" on the scene, you will have 2 instances of "Tree". At the beginning of the scene, these instances will have both a variable "LifeAmount", with the same value (the one entered in the variables editor). Then, during the game, according to conditions and actions, the value of each can evolve.
