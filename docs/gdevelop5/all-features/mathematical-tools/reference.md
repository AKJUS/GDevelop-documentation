A set of mathematical functions that can be used in expressions. 

## Expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `AngleBetweenPositions()` | Compute the angle between two positions (in degrees). ||
| `AngleDifference()` | Difference between two angles ||
| `DistanceBetweenPositions()` | Compute the distance between two positions. ||
| `Pi()` | The number Pi (3.1415...) ||
| `Random()` | Random integer ||
| `RandomFloat()` | Random float ||
| `RandomFloatInRange()` | Random float in range ||
| `RandomInRange()` | Random integer in range ||
| `RandomWithStep()` | Random value in steps ||
| `XFromAngleAndDistance()` | Compute the X position when given an angle and distance relative to the origin (0;0). This is also known as getting the cartesian coordinates of a 2D vector, using its polar coordinates. ||
| `YFromAngleAndDistance()` | Compute the Y position when given an angle and distance relative to the origin (0;0). This is also known as getting the cartesian coordinates of a 2D vector, using its polar coordinates. ||
| `abs()` | Absolute value ||
| `acos()` | Arccosine, return an angle (in radian). `ToDeg` allows to convert it to degrees. ||
| `acosh()` | Hyperbolic arccosine ||
| `asin()` | Arcsine, return an angle (in radian). `ToDeg` allows to convert it to degrees. ||
| `asinh()` | Arcsine ||
| `atan()` | Arctangent, return an angle (in radian). `ToDeg` allows to convert it to degrees. ||
| `atan2()` | 2 argument arctangent (atan2) ||
| `atanh()` | Hyperbolic arctangent ||
| `cbrt()` | Cube root ||
| `ceil()` | Round number up to an integer ||
| `ceilTo()` | Round number up to the Nth decimal place ||
| `clamp()` | Restrict a value to a given range ||
| `cos()` | Cosine of an angle (in radian). If you want to use degrees, use`ToRad`: `sin(ToRad(45))`. ||
| `cosh()` | Hyperbolic cosine ||
| `cot()` | Cotangent of a number ||
| `csc()` | Cosecant of a number ||
| `exp()` | Exponential of a number ||
| `floor()` | Round number down to an integer ||
| `floorTo()` | Round number down to the Nth decimal place ||
| `lerp()` | Linearly interpolate a to b by x ||
| `lerpAngle()` | Linearly interpolates between two angles (in degrees) by taking the shortest direction around the circle. ||
| `log()` | Logarithm ||
| `log10()` | Base-10 logarithm ||
| `log2()` | Base 2 Logarithm ||
| `max()` | Maximum of two numbers ||
| `min()` | Minimum of two numbers ||
| `mod()` | x mod y ||
| `normalize()` | Remap a value between 0 and 1. ||
| `nthroot()` | Nth root of a number ||
| `pow()` | Raise a number to power n ||
| `round()` | Round a number ||
| `roundTo()` | Round a number to the Nth decimal place ||
| `sec()` | Secant ||
| `sign()` | Return the sign of a number (1,-1 or 0) ||
| `sin()` | Sine of an angle (in radian). If you want to use degrees, use`ToRad`: `sin(ToRad(45))`. ||
| `sinh()` | Hyperbolic sine ||
| `sqrt()` | Square root of a number ||
