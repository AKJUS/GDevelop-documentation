# Asynchronous functions Reference

Functions that defer the execution of the events after it. 

## Actions

**End asynchronous function**  
Mark an asynchronous function as finished. This will allow the actions and subevents following it to be run.

The Asynchronous functions extension is always installed in all GDevelop projects: there is no need to add it from the Project Manager.
