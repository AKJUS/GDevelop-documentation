# Timers and time Reference

Actions and conditions to start, pause or reset scene timers, modify the time scale (speed at which the game is running - useful for slow motion effects). Also contains an action that wait for a delay before running the next actions and sub-events and expressions to read the time scale, time delta of the last frame or timer elapsed time. [Read more explanations about it.](/gdevelop5/all-features/timers-and-time)

## Actions

**Time scale**  
Change the time scale of the scene.

**Pause a scene timer**  
Pause a scene timer.

**Delete a scene timer**  
Delete a scene timer from memory.

**Start (or reset) a scene timer**  
Reset the specified scene timer, if the timer doesn't exist it's created and started.

**Unpause a scene timer**  
Unpause a scene timer.

**Wait X seconds**  
Waits a number of seconds before running the next actions (and sub-events).

## Conditions

**Value of a scene timer**

Compare the time scale of the scene.

**Scene timer paused**  
Test if the specified scene timer is paused.
