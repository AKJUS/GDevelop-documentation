# Lights Reference

This provides a 2D light object, and a behavior to mark other 2D objects as being obstacles for the lights. This is a great way to create a special atmosphere to your game, along with effects, make it more realistic or to create gameplays based on lights. 



## Light 

Displays a 2D light on the scene, with a customizable radius and color. Add then the Light Obstacle behavior to the objects that must act as obstacle to the lights. 

### Object actions
