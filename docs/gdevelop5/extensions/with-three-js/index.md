**Change 3D Object DepthWrite (experimental)**  
Change the DepthWrite of a 3D Object.  
Whether rendering this 3D Object has any effect on the depth buffer.
If transparent 3D Objects overlap and render incorrectly, you may be able to obtain ideal rendering results by setting the DepthWrite of that 3D Object to No.
Default is Yes.
