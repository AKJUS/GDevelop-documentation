Provides an expression to get the current FPS and a text object behavior to display the current FPS.

Frames Per Second (FPS) describes how many times in the last second your game logic was executed. 
This includes running behaviors and events, and then rendering the new game state into the game window. The higher the FPS, the more fluid and performant your game looks.

Note: Use the Performance Profiler (inside in the Debugger) for detailed performance information about your game.
