This simple extension enables you to add a system, where a player needs to double press a certain key for an action to happen. 
For example you can add a sprinting system similar to Minecraft's, where you need to press W twice to start running.

The extension adds 3 conditions:
Specific key double pressed
Specific key double pressed (text expression)
Any key double pressed
