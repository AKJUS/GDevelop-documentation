Make an object flash for a period of time so that it alternates between two different states.
Includes the ability to flash visibility (blink), color tint, object effect, or opacity (fade).

After adding a behavior to an object, you **trigger the effect** by using the **Flash action**.

This can be used to:

- Let players know they are invincible after being hit
- Catch player attention on the interface (for instance a "press start" text)
