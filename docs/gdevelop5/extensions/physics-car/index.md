## Physics car 

Simulate 2D car motion, from a top-down view. 

### Behavior actions

**Draw forces for debug**  
Draw forces applying on the car for debug purpose.

**Acceleration**  
Change the acceleration of the object.

**Maximum speed**  
Change the maximum speed of the object.

**Steering angle**  
Change the steering angle of the object.

**Maximum steering angle**  
Change the maximum steering angle of the object.

**Sterring back speed**  
Change the sterring speed when turning back of the object.

**Steering speed**  
Change the steering speed of the object.

**Wheel grip ratio**  
Change the wheel grip ratio of the object (from 0 to 1). A ratio of 0 is like driving on ice.

**Simulate acceleration stick**  
Simulate an acceleration stick for a given axis force.

**Simulate down key press**  
Simulate a press of the down key.

**Simulate left key press**  
Simulate a press of the left key.

**Simulate right key press**  
Simulate a press of the right key.

**Simulate steering stick**  
Simulate a steering stick for a given axis force.

**Simulate up key press**  
Simulate a press of the up key.

### Behavior conditions

**Acceleration**  
Compare the acceleration of the object.

**Maximum speed**  
Compare the maximum speed of the object.

**Steering angle**  
Compare the steering angle of the object.

**Maximum steering angle**  
Compare the maximum steering angle of the object.

**Sterring back speed**  
Compare the sterring speed when turning back of the object.

**Steering speed**  
Compare the steering speed of the object.

**Wheel grip ratio**  
Compare the wheel grip ratio of the object (from 0 to 1). A ratio of 0 is like driving on ice.
