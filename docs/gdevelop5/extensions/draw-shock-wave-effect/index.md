This behavior must be assigned to a shape painter object.
The user will have state parameters (Start and End) like the particle emitter object, which are :


- Type(Fill or Line)
- The color transition (Start / End).
- The opacity transition (Start / End).
- The transition of angle (Start / End).
- The transition of the radius of the explosion (Start / End).
- The transition of the contour size (Start / End).
- The duration of the propagation.

The user can modify the values according to his needs.

You can modify the value of the object just after the creation of the object in the event sheet (all modifications are applied on the shape painter object created above the modification).

PS: the shape-painter will be automatically deleted once the animation is finished.
