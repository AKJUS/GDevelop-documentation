Change 3D models proportions over time to make smooth animations like wobbling.

It's used in this example:

* a 3D Bomberman-like game ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://3d-bomber-bunny))

Breaking changes of 0.1.0:

- The Tween behavior is now required by the 3D Tween behavior. Add the Tween behavior on any object that uses the 3D Tween behavior

## 3D tween (experimental) 

Smoothly animate scale and rotation of 3d models. 

### Behavior actions

**Pause a tween**  
Pause the running tween animation.

**Remove a tween**  
Remove the tween animation from the object.

**Resume a tween**  
Resume the tween animation.

**Scale volume**  
Change the scale volume.

**Stretch on Y axis**  
Change the stretch on Y axis. The object volume is conserved. A stretch of 2 makes the object appear 2 times longer on Y in proportion to the dimensions on X and Z.

**Stretch on Z axis**  
Change the stretch on Z axis. The object volume is conserved. A stretch of 2 makes the object appear 2 times longer on Z in proportion to the dimensions on X and Y.

**Stop a tween**  
Stop the running tween animation.

**Tween scale volume**  
Tweens an object scale volume from its current value to a new one. The scale volume can never be 0 or less.

**Tween stretch Y**  
Tweens an object stretch Y from its current value to a new one. The stretch can never be 0 or less.

**Tween stretch Z**  
Tweens an object stretch Z from its current value to a new one. The stretch can never be 0 or less.

### Behavior conditions

**Tween exists**  
Check if the tween animation exists.

**Tween finished playing**  
Check if the tween animation has finished playing.

**Tween is playing**  
Check if the tween animation is currently playing.

**Progress of a tween**  
Compare the progress of a tween (between 0.0 and 1.0).

**Scale volume**  
Compare the scale volume.

**Stretch on Y axis**  
Compare the stretch on Y axis. The object volume is conserved. A stretch of 2 makes the object appear 2 times longer on Y in proportion to the dimensions on X and Z.

**Stretch on Z axis**  
Compare the stretch on Z axis. The object volume is conserved. A stretch of 2 makes the object appear 2 times longer on Z in proportion to the dimensions on X and Y.

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.Tween3D::Progress()` | Return the progress of a tween (between 0.0 and 1.0). ||
| `Object.Tween3D::ScaleVolume()` | Return the scale volume. ||
| `Object.Tween3D::StretchY()` | Return the stretch on Y axis. The object volume is conserved. A stretch of 2 makes the object appear 2 times longer on Y in proportion to the dimensions on X and Z. ||
| `Object.Tween3D::StretchZ()` | Return the stretch on Z axis. The object volume is conserved. A stretch of 2 makes the object appear 2 times longer on Z in proportion to the dimensions on X and Y. ||

## 3D wobble 

Squash and stretch a 3D model in loop. 

### Behavior actions

**Cycle duration**  
Change the cycle duration of the object.

**Maximum scale volume**  
Change the maximum scale volume of the object.

**Minimum scale volume**  
Change the minimum scale volume of the object.

**Scale cycle offset**  
Change the scale cycle offset of the object.

**Maximum stretch**  
Change the maximum stretch of the object.

**Minimum stretch**  
Change the minimum stretch of the object.

**Stretch cycle offset**  
Change the stretch cycle offset of the object.

**Tween maximum scale volume**  
Tweens the maximum scale volume from its current value to a new one. The scale volume can never be 0 or less.

**Tween minimum scale volume**  
Tweens the minimum scale volume from its current value to a new one. The scale volume can never be 0 or less.

### Behavior conditions

**Cycle duration**  
Compare the cycle duration of the object.

**Maximum scale volume**  
Compare the maximum scale volume of the object.

**Minimum scale volume**  
Compare the minimum scale volume of the object.

**Scale cycle offset**  
Compare the scale cycle offset of the object.

**Maximum stretch**  
Compare the maximum stretch of the object.

**Minimum stretch**  
Compare the minimum stretch of the object.

**Stretch cycle offset**  
Compare the stretch cycle offset of the object.

### Behavior expressions

| Expression | Description |  |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `Object.Wobble::PeriodDuration()` | Return the cycle duration of the object. ||
| `Object.Wobble::ScaleMax()` | Return the maximum scale volume of the object. ||
| `Object.Wobble::ScaleMin()` | Return the minimum scale volume of the object. ||
| `Object.Wobble::ScalePeriodOffset()` | Return the scale cycle offset of the object. ||
| `Object.Wobble::StretchMax()` | Return the maximum stretch of the object. ||
| `Object.Wobble::StretchMin()` | Return the minimum stretch of the object. ||
| `Object.Wobble::StretchPeriodOffset()` | Return the stretch cycle offset of the object. ||
