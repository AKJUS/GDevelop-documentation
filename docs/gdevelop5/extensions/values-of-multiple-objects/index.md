Provides values based on picked object instances.  
Useful for camera tracking, flocking behaviors, and more.

Included expressions

Center points:

- X center point (absolute) 
- Y center point (absolute)
- X center point (average) 
- Y center point (average)

Position expressions (based on AABB of objects):

- Minimum X position
- Minimum Y position
- Maximum X position
- Maximum Y position

Force expressions:

- Average horizontal force (X)
- Average vertical force (Y)

Angle expressions:

- Average angle of rotation

Size expressions:

- Width (min/max/average)
- Height (min/max/average)

Z-order expressions: (min/max/average)
