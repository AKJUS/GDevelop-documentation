Move camera to the room that contains the trigger object (usually the player).  If desired, change zoom to show the entire room or keep zoom static.

How to use:

- Place room objects on scene
- Select camera zoom limits, how fast the camera should move, and the visible buffer around each room
- Run the "Move and zoom camera" action on every frame
- Move the trigger object (player) between rooms and the camera will center on the room that contains the trigger object.

Tips:

- Use these conditions for custom logic when changing rooms : "Camera moving", "Camera zooming", and "Room changed"
- Set "Lerp Speed" to "1" to change the camera instantly
