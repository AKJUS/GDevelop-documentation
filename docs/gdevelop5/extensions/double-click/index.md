Check for a double-click with a mouse, or a tap and double-click on a touchscreen.

Please note: Touch devices do not have alternatives for middle/right clicks. Taps on a touch device will get counted for _any_ use of these conditions, so you should either design your controls accordingly, or build out separate events if the device has a touch screen.

## Conditions

**Double-clicked (or double-tapped)**  
Check if the specified mouse button is clicked twice in a short amount of time.

??? quote "See parameters & details"

    - Parameter 1 (mouseButton): Mouse button to track
      As touch devices do not have middle/right tap equivalents, you will need to account for this within your events if you're not using the left mouse button and building for touch devices.

    > Technical note: parameters 0, 2 are internal parameters handled by GDevelop.

    > Technical note: this condition internal type (in GDevelop JSON) is `DoubleClick::HasDoubleClicked`.
