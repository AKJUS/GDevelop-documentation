Check for a double-click with a mouse, or a tap and double-click on a touchscreen.

Please note: Touch devices do not have alternatives for middle/right clicks. Taps on a touch device will get counted for _any_ use of these conditions, so you should either design your controls accordingly, or build out separate events if the device has a touch screen.

Breaking changes from 2.0.0:

- Mouse button value now needs quotes
- The double-click sensitivity now relies on the device settings
