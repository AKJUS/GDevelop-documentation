Display a large number of particles in 3D to create visual effects in a 3D game.

3D particle emitters let you create and display many small particles to simulate visual effects in your game â€” like fire, explosions, smoke, or dust.

The parameters of the object can be configured in multiple different ways to create a specific desired effect. GDevelop will give a set of a pre-configured 3D particle emitters that you should try first.

Use these 3D particle emitters in 3D games. For 2D games or particles that appear on a game's 2D user interface, use the 2D particle emitter object instead.
