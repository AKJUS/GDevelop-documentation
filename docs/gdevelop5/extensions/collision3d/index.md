## Actions

**Separate objects in 3D**  
Move an object away from another using their collision masks. Object rotation around X and Y axes are ignored.  
Be sure to call this action on a reasonable number of objects to avoid slowing down the game.

## Conditions

**Collision in 3D**  
Check the collision between two objects using their collision masks. Object rotation around X and Y axes are ignored.

**Distance between two objects in 3D**  
Compare the distance between two objects in 3D.

**Pick nearest object in 3D**  
Pick the object of this type that is nearest to the specified position in 3D.

## Expressions

| Expression | Description |  |

| `Collision3D::DistanceToPosition()` | Distance between an object and a position in 3D. ||
| `Collision3D::SqDistance()` | Square distance between two objects in 3D. ||
