Check collision and distance between 3D objects and separate them from each other.

!!! tip
    Learn [how to install new extensions](/gdevelop5/extensions/search) by following a step-by-step guide.

## Actions

**Separate objects in 3D**  
Move an object away from another using their collision masks. Object rotation around X and Y axes are ignored.  
Be sure to call this action on a reasonable number of objects to avoid slowing down the game.

## Conditions

**Collision in 3D**  
Check the collision between two objects using their collision masks. Object rotation around X and Y axes are ignored.

**Distance between two objects in 3D**  
Compare the distance between two objects in 3D.

**Pick nearest object in 3D**  
Pick the object of this type that is nearest to the specified position in 3D.
