Move an object in a circle around a specific point while pointing the moving object away from the center of the circle.
This feature is useful in games for weapons or targeting indicators that move around a player character.
Orbit distance and rotation speed can be changed easily.

The target position action can be used to follow the direction of the cursor.
The target angle action can be used to follow hte direction of a gamepad stick

??? quote "See parameters"

    - Parameter 1 (ðŸ‘¾ Object): Gun object
      The object that is going to orbit and rotate.
    - Parameter 2 (ðŸ”¢ Number): Orbit around this X position
      Gun object will orbit around this X position.
    - Parameter 3 (ðŸ”¢ Number): Orbit around this Y position
      Gun object will orbit around this Y position.
    - Parameter 4 (ðŸ”¢ Number): Orbit distance (in pixels)
      Distance between the Gun object and the Orbit positions X and Y.  
      Example: 50 .
    - Parameter 5 (ðŸ”¢ Number): Point to this X position
      Point the gun object to this Xposition.
    - Parameter 6 (ðŸ”¢ Number): Point to this Y position
      Point the gun object to this Yposition.
    - Parameter 7 (ðŸ”¢ Number): Pointing speed (in deg/second)
      Set to 0 for an immediate pointing.

    > Technical note: parameters 0, 8 are internal parameters handled by GDevelop.
