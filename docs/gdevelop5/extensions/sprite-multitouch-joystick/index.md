Multitouch joysticks are objects showing a joystick on the screen, useful for mobile. They work like a physical gamepad:

- 4 or 8 directions
- Analogus pads
- Player selection
- Automatic "mapper" behaviors for 2D and 3D movement behaviors (platformer characters, top-down movement, 3D character etc...). Add one of these to the object with the movement behavior (i.e: the player most of the time) and the behavior will then be controlled automatically by the virtual joystick (it works by reading the multitouch joystick state and simulating controls). No need for additional events to make it work once the behaviors are set up.

There are ready-to-use joysticks in the asset-store [multitouch joysticks pack](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?initial-dialog=asset-store&asset-pack=multitouch-joysticks-multitouch-joysticks).

Check if a new touch has started on the right or left side of the screen.

**Multitouch controller button pressed**  
Check if a button is pressed on a gamepad.

**Multitouch controller button released**  
Check if a button is released on a gamepad.

**Joystick pushed in a direction (4-way)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Joystick pushed in a direction (8-way)**

## Multitouch Joystick 

Joystick for touchscreens. 

### Object actions

**De/activate control**  
De/activate control of the joystick.

**Multitouch controller identifier**  
Change the multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...).

**Dead zone radius**  
Change the dead zone radius of the joystick (range: 0 to 1). The deadzone is an area for which movement on sticks won't be taken into account (instead, the stick will be considered as not moved).

**Joystick name**  
Change the joystick name of the object.

**Show and start pressing**  
Show the joystick until it is released.

### Object conditions

**Multitouch controller identifier**  
Compare the multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...).

**Dead zone radius**  
Compare the dead zone radius of the joystick (range: 0 to 1). The deadzone is an area for which movement on sticks won't be taken into account (instead, the stick will be considered as not moved).

**Joystick pushed in a direction (4-way movement)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Joystick pushed in a direction (8-way movement)**  
Check if joystick is pushed in a given direction.

**Stick pressed**  
Check if a stick is pressed.

**Joystick name**  
Compare the joystick name of the object.

**Stick force**  
Compare the strick force (from 0 to 1).

**Stick X force**  
Compare the stick force on X axis (from -1 at the left to 1 at the right).

**Stick Y force**  
Compare the stick force on Y axis (from -1 at the top to 1 at the bottom).

### Object expressions

| Expression | Description |  |

| `Object.ControllerIdentifier()` | Return the multitouch controller identifier (1, 2, 3, 4...). ||
| `Object.DeadZoneRadius()` | Return the dead zone radius of the joystick (range: 0 to 1). The deadzone is an area for which movement on sticks won't be taken into account (instead, the stick will be considered as not moved). ||
| `Object.JoystickIdentifier()` | Return the joystick name of the object. ||
| `Object.StickAngle()` | Return the angle the stick is pointing towards (from -180 to 180). ||
