Shake layer cameras on 3 rotations.


- Short shaking can be used to give impact (explosion, hit)
- Shaking can go indefinitely to set an ambiance (engine vibration, earthquake, pulsing)
- Low frequency shaking allows to simulate slow moving objects (ship rocking back and forth)

## Actions

**Horizontal rotation amplitude**  
Change the horizontal rotation amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Shakable layer**  
Mark a layer as shakable.

**Layer shaking frequency**  
Change the number of back and forth per seconds.

**Spinning shake amplitude**  
Change the spinning amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Vertical rotation amplitude**  
Change the vertical rotation amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Shake camera**  
Shake the camera on layers chosen with configuration actions.

**Start camera shaking**  
Start shaking the camera indefinitely.

**Stop camera shaking**  
Stop shaking the camera.

## Conditions

**Horizontal rotation amplitude**  
Compare the horizontal rotation amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Camera is shaking**  
Check if the camera is shaking.

**Spinning shake amplitude**  
Compare the spinning amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).

**Vertical rotation amplitude**  
Compare the vertical rotation amplitude of the shaking (in degrees).
