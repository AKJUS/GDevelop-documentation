Add support for gamepads (or other physical controllers).

It gives access to:

- button presses,
- axis positions and force,
- trigger pressure,
- configurable deadzone,
- vibration,
- automatic "gamepad mapper" behaviors for 2D and 3D movement behaviors (platformer characters, top-down movement, 3D character etc...). Add one of these to the object with the movement behavior (i.e: the player most of the time) and the behavior will then be controlled automatically by the gamepad (it works by reading the gamepad state and simulating controls). No need for additional events to make it work once the behaviors are set up.

The Bomberman-like example handles 4 players with gamepads ([open the project online](https://editor.gdevelop.io/?project=example://goose-bomberman)).

## Actions

**Advanced gamepad vibration**  
Generate an advanced vibration on the specified controller. Incompatible with Firefox.

**Change gamepad active vibration**  
Change a vibration on the specified controller. Incompatible with Firefox.

**Set gamepad deadzone for sticks**  
Set the deadzone for sticks of the gamepad. The deadzone is an area for which movement on sticks won't be taken into account (instead, the stick will be considered as not moved). Deadzone is between 0 and 1, and is by default 0.2.

**Gamepad vibration**  
Generate a vibration on the specified controller. Might only work if the game is running in a recent web browser.

## Conditions

**Any gamepad button pressed**  
Check if any button is pressed on a gamepad.

**Gamepad stick pushed (axis)**  
Check if a stick of a gamepad is pushed in a given direction.

**Gamepad button pressed**  
Check if a button is pressed on a gamepad.   
Buttons can be:
* Xbox: "A", "B", "X", "Y", "LB", "RB", "LT", "RT", "BACK", "START",
* PS4: "CROSS", "SQUARE", "CIRCLE", "TRIANGLE", "L1", "L2", "R1", "R2", "SHARE", "OPTIONS", "PS_BUTTON", "CLICK_TOUCHPAD",
* Other: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "CLICK_STICK_LEFT", "CLICK_STICK_RIGHT".

**Gamepad button released**  
Test if a button is released on a gamepad. Buttons can be:  
* Xbox: "A", "B", "X", "Y", "LB", "RB", "LT", "RT", "BACK", "START",
* PS4: "CROSS", "SQUARE", "CIRCLE", "TRIANGLE", "L1", "L2", "R1", "R2", "SHARE", "OPTIONS", "PS_BUTTON", "CLICK_TOUCHPAD",
* Other: "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "CLICK_STICK_LEFT", "CLICK_STICK_RIGHT".

**Gamepad connected**  
Check if a gamepad is connected.

**Gamepad type**  
Check if the specified gamepad has the specified information in its description. Useful to know if the gamepad is a Xbox or PS4 controller.

**Any gamepad button released**  
Check if any button is released on a gamepad.

**Stick force**  
Compare the force of gamepad stick (from 0 to 1).
