## Teaching resources (curriculum)

The GDevelop for Education plan gives access to **a curriculum designed by the GDevelop team and by teachers**. It includes multiple ready-to-teach lessons that cover game development theory and step-by-step practical lessons to create full games.

Once you've purchased the GDevelop for Education plan, these curriculum and extra educational resources are accessible from the Classroom tab, visible for teachers.

## Getting the Education plan

The Education plan is purchased with at least 5 seats. A seat is either occupied by a teacher account, or a student account.
For instance with 10 seats you can have:

- 1 teacher account;
- 9 student accounts.

**All accounts benefits from the same perks as a Gold subscription** (see details [here](https://gdevelop.io/pricing)). This includes the possibility for students to work on their project using the GDevelop mobile app, available for Android tablets and phones, as well as iPads and iPhone.

## Teacher accounts: managing students and their work

Besides teaching resources, teacher accounts gain access to the Classrooms tab on GDevelop's homepage.

In this tab, they can view all the student accounts linked to the plan. The student accounts can be sorted into Rooms for a better organization between teachers:

A teacher has access to the projects made by each student. They can open them in a read-only mode. This is useful for:

- Checking or marking the work done on the projects;
- Preview the game to ensure the game itself works as intended.

## Student accounts: optimized for learning

Student accounts are fully anonymized accounts which can be administrated by teachers. The credentials for those accounts (disposable email address + password) are accessible to teachers from the "Manage Seats" page, available through the Classrooms tab:

    If you have specific needs related to how students should access their accounts (reuse existing emails, SSO, etc...), please reach out to us.

Some concepts in GDevelop's editor have been hidden to student accounts so that they can focus on their work in class:

- Premium products;
- Credits;
- Social networks mentions;
- Announcements and ads;
- GDevelop gaming page.

Student accounts also have access to the version history feature for Cloud projects: they can go back to any previous save they made.
