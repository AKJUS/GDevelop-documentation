## For each child variable (of a structure or array)

**For each child variable** events give the [child variables](/gdevelop5/all-features/variables/) from structure variables (or arrays) one at a time to their sub-events.

This event stores the value of each child variable (as a string or number) and the name of the child variable (as a string) into the scene variables you specify in the parameters of the event.

## How to add this event

Right click (or long press) on an existing [event](/gdevelop5/events) and choose *"Add Other"* in the menu. Then, select the event you want to add.
Alternatively, click on the *"Plus" icon* in the toolbar or on *"Add..."* at the bottom of the events sheet.

## Example

- Define a structure variable (Fruits) with multiple child variables (Apple, Avocado, Banana)

!!! tip

    The [for each object](/gdevelop5/events/foreach) event page explains how to loop on objects one by one.
